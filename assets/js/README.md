# Weather Dashboard Challenge

# Description 

A straight forward weather dashboard using the Open Weather One Call API featuring a search bar for city input, and a dynamically generated list of buttons for recently searched cities. Upon searching a location, weather data will be generated on the right side of the page to display to you the current weather conditions for your searched location, as well as a 5-day forecast for the upcoming days. Icons have been added for user quality.
